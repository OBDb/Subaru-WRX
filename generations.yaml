generations:
  - name: "First Generation (GC/GF)"
    start_year: 1992
    end_year: 2000
    description: "The first-generation Subaru WRX, based on the Impreza platform, was introduced in Japan and other global markets (but not North America) as a high-performance variant developed from Subaru's rally racing experience. Available in four-door sedan (GC) and five-door wagon (GF) body styles, the original WRX featured subtle but functional performance modifications including a turbocharged 2.0-liter flat-four 'boxer' engine producing approximately 240 horsepower, enhanced suspension, larger brakes, and standard all-wheel drive. Visually distinguished from standard Impreza models by wider body panels, a hood scoop to direct air to the top-mounted intercooler, and unique wheels, the WRX established the template for the rally-inspired road car that would define the model through subsequent generations. The interior maintained the basic layout of the standard Impreza but added sport seats, a three-spoke steering wheel, and additional gauges in some versions. Performance was impressive for the era, with 0-60 mph times of approximately 5.8 seconds and handling that benefited from the low center of gravity provided by the boxer engine and the traction of the all-wheel drive system. Special variants included the limited-production 22B with widened bodywork, a 2.2-liter engine, and unique styling elements commemorating Subaru's World Rally Championship success. This generation established the WRX's reputation for offering supercar-rivaling performance and all-weather capability in a practical, relatively affordable package, developing a devoted enthusiast following and contributing significantly to Subaru's performance image."

  - name: "Second Generation (GD/GG)"
    start_year: 2000
    end_year: 2007
    description: "The second-generation Subaru WRX continued to evolve the rally-bred performance formula while expanding to new markets, including North America where it was officially introduced for the 2002 model year. Available in four-door sedan (GD) and five-door wagon (GG) body styles, the new WRX featured more aggressive styling with prominent round headlights (often referred to as 'bug eyes') in its initial form, later revised in 2003 ('blob eye') and 2005 ('hawk eye') facelifts. Powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter flat-four 'boxer' engine in most global markets or a 2.5-liter version in North America, the WRX produced between 227 and 280 horsepower depending on market and model year. All versions featured Subaru's symmetrical all-wheel drive system, paired primarily with a five-speed manual transmission with an automatic option available in some markets. The interior offered improved materials and design compared to the first generation, though still focused on functionality over luxury, with sport seats, a MOMO steering wheel in many versions, and aluminum pedal covers. This generation coincided with increased awareness of the WRX in popular culture, particularly through rally racing, motorsports video games, and films, helping establish the model as a performance icon. Special variants included the WRX STI, which became a separate model line with more substantial performance upgrades, and various limited editions with unique colors and equipment. The second-generation WRX significantly expanded the model's global reach and enthusiast following, cementing its reputation for offering accessible performance with practical everyday usability."

  - name: "Third Generation (GE/GH/GR/GV)"
    start_year: 2007
    end_year: 2014
    description: "The third-generation Subaru WRX, initially marketed as part of the Impreza line before becoming a separate model later in this generation, represented a significant redesign with a focus on broadening appeal while maintaining performance capabilities. Available in four-door sedan (GE/GV) and five-door hatchback (GH/GR) body styles, the new WRX featured more mainstream styling than its predecessor, particularly in the early years of this generation. Powered by a turbocharged 2.5-liter flat-four 'boxer' engine in most markets, the WRX produced approximately 265 horsepower, delivered through Subaru's symmetrical all-wheel drive system paired with a five-speed manual transmission, with an automatic option available in some regions. In 2011, the WRX received a significant update that more clearly differentiated it from the standard Impreza, featuring widened body panels, a more aggressive front end, and unique quad exhaust outlets. The interior saw improvements in material quality and design, with available features including navigation systems, premium audio, and enhanced safety equipment. This generation marked a period of transition for the WRX, evolving from its raw, rally-derived character toward a more refined, accessible performance car, though still maintaining the turbocharged boxer engine and all-wheel drive formula that defined the model. Special editions included the limited-production WRX STI spec C and spec R in Japan, featuring reduced weight and track-focused upgrades. The third-generation WRX continued to build the model's enthusiast following while appealing to a broader audience with improved daily usability and comfort, though some purists felt it had lost some of the raw character that defined earlier versions."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (VA)"
    start_year: 2015
    end_year: 2021
    description: "The fourth-generation Subaru WRX marked the model's complete separation from the Impreza line, becoming a distinct model with its own platform modifications and styling, though still sharing some underlying architecture with the Impreza. Available exclusively as a four-door sedan in most markets, the new WRX featured more aggressive, distinctive styling with a prominent hood scoop, flared fenders, and quad exhaust outlets. Powertrain saw a significant change with the introduction of a new 2.0-liter direct-injection turbocharged flat-four 'boxer' engine (FA20) replacing the previous 2.5-liter unit in most markets, producing 268 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a six-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT) marketed as the 'Sport Lineartronic' with simulated gear steps. All models continued to feature Subaru's symmetrical all-wheel drive system, with different versions depending on the transmission choice. The interior represented a significant upgrade from previous generations, with improved materials, a more modern design, and enhanced technology including a central touchscreen infotainment system with available navigation and smartphone integration. A key focus was improving refinement and daily usability without compromising performance capabilities, with revised suspension tuning, a more rigid chassis, and reduced interior noise. This generation introduced more advanced driver assistance features on CVT-equipped models, including Subaru's EyeSight system offering adaptive cruise control and pre-collision braking. Special variants included the limited-production Series.Gray with unique styling elements and the WRX STI, which maintained the older EJ25 2.5-liter engine but with increased output and substantial chassis upgrades. The fourth-generation WRX successfully balanced improved refinement and technology with the performance characteristics expected of the nameplate, maintaining its position as a benchmark for affordable all-weather performance cars."

  - name: "Fifth Generation (VB)"
    start_year: 2022
    end_year: null
    description: "The fifth-generation Subaru WRX represents the most comprehensive redesign in the model's history, built on the Subaru Global Platform that underpins most of the company's modern lineup but with extensive performance-focused modifications. Available exclusively as a four-door sedan, the new WRX features more aggressive styling with prominent fender flares, functional air vents on the front fenders and rear bumper, a larger hood scoop, and distinctive rear diffuser with quad exhaust tips. A significant change is the addition of contrasting black plastic cladding around the wheel arches and lower body, a controversial design element that polarized enthusiast opinion. Powered by a new 2.4-liter turbocharged flat-four 'boxer' engine producing 271 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque (a modest increase in horsepower but across a broader rev range), the WRX is available with either a six-speed manual transmission or a new Subaru Performance Transmission (SPT)—a specially tuned continuously variable transmission with faster shift responses than the previous generation. All models continue to feature Subaru's symmetrical all-wheel drive system, with different versions depending on transmission choice. The interior has been completely redesigned with a more modern, technology-focused approach featuring an available 11.6-inch portrait-oriented touchscreen infotainment system, improved materials, and more supportive front seats. For the first time, the WRX is available in a GT trim that combines the SPT with electronically controlled dampers offering Comfort, Normal, and Sport settings—the first adaptive suspension ever offered on a WRX. Safety technology has been expanded with Subaru's EyeSight driver assistance system standard on all SPT-equipped models, offering adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, and emergency braking. Notably, for this generation, there is no STI variant planned, with Subaru announcing that it would not produce an STI version of the VB platform as it focuses on electrification strategies for future performance models. The fifth-generation WRX continues to target enthusiast drivers seeking all-weather performance with everyday practicality, now with enhanced technology and refinement, though its styling and the absence of an STI variant have proven controversial among the model's traditional fan base."
